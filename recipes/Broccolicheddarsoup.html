    <p>This creamy high protein broccoli Cheddar soup is packed full of veggies and gets its creaminess—and extra protein—from beans and cottage cheese. The soup is partially blended for a nice, thick base.</p>
    <p><h2>"Ingridients"</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 table spoons butter</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>

        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds broccoli, chopped</li>
